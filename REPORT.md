*Delete this italic guidance as you fill in each section. You'll be asked to
defend any of this without your code in front of you. Write only what you
can actually explain.*

## Business problem, and the cost of being wrong

*The decision this model supports, who or what acts on it, and what happens
when it's wrong in each direction. Be concrete about the asymmetry: which
mistake is worse, roughly by how much, and why. Everything downstream (your
threshold, how much you send to a person, which metric you care about) has to trace
back to this section.*

## Dataset

*Workspace / project / version on Roboflow Universe, and the link. What one
image represents, what the classes are, and why this dataset actually serves
the problem above rather than merely resembling it.*

## What the dataset's composition implies

*Instances per class, train/val/test sizes, typical object size relative to the
image. Then the interpretation: which per-class numbers will be too thin to
trust, whether the test split resembles the images you'd really see, and what
you therefore can't conclude from your results.*

## Finetuning and baselines

*Which model and task (detection or classification) and why. A results table on
the same test split: your finetuned model, the pretrained COCO model zero-shot,
and a trivial baseline. What changed, and whether the gap is as large as you
expected.*

## Per-class evaluation and failure modes

*Per-class AP50, or per-class precision/recall and the confusion matrix.
Which class carries the headline number, which one is dragging, and what the
model actually confuses with what. Show where it breaks, not just that it
works.*

## Cost matrix and operating point

*Your euro cost for each kind of error and where each figure came from. The
base rate you assumed. The cost-against-threshold sweep, and the operating
point you chose. State the assumption that would most change your answer if it
were wrong.*

## What a person still has to check

*Your two thresholds, and what share of cases they send to a person. How many
that is per day, how long one takes to check, and how many people that needs.
Is that realistic? Then your design priced against the three alternatives:
doing nothing, having a person check everything, and letting the model decide
on its own.*

## Limitations & next steps

*Real limitations you found, and concretely how you'd address each one with
more time or data. Not generic hedging.*

## Generative AI use disclosure

*Per the syllabus AI Policy: what you used and how, or "no AI content used."*
